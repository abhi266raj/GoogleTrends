```sh
git clone https://github.com/abhi266raj/GoogleTrends.git
cd GoogleTrends
Scripts/build-xcframework.sh
swift build
swift test
Scripts/verify-products.sh
```

The root test suite imports GoogleTrendsSource. The consumer check tests both public
products separately. Changes to library code require a new versioned XCFramework;
see [distribution guidance](Distribution/README.md) and [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md).

Tests use deterministic injected transports; no live network in unit tests. Run Scripts/verify-platforms.sh when changing public API.

GoogleTrends owns generic feed discovery and parsing. Applications own UI, caching, factual validation and retry policy. Use protocols, Sendable values and async/await; inject transports. New behavior needs focused contract tests.
